# 🍽️ Restaurant Review System  

This project is all about building a **Restaurant Review System** using **Sentiment Analysis** and **Machine Learning models**.  
It classifies restaurant reviews as **positive** or **negative**, helping businesses and customers understand feedback more effectively.

## 📌 Features  
- Preprocessing of textual reviews (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).  
- Implementation of **Bag of Words (BoW)** / **TF-IDF** for feature extraction.  
- Multiple ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Simple and interpretable sentiment classification.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → Data Handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` → ML models & evaluation  
  - `nltk` / `spacy` → Text preprocessing
